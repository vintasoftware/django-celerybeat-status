A library that integrates with django admin and shows in a simple GUI when your periodic are going to run next.

## Instalation

```bash
pip install django-celerybeat-status
```

## Configuration

1. Add `"celerybeat_status"` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` variable in django settings

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
  ...
  "celerybeat_status",
]
```

2. Create a url for the status check view

```python
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
  # other urls...
  path("admin/statuscheck/", include("celerybeat_status.urls", namespace="celerybeat_status")),
]
```

## Usage

You can also find a link in `/admin` sidebar.
